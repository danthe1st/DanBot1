# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on github because anyone can see this issue and use it.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

Instead, they should be either reported to [daniel@wwwmaster.at](mailto:daniel@wwwmaster.at) or
as a private message on Discord to user `dan1st#7327`.
If there are any general questions or a private message to that usercannot be send, visit the [Support Server](https://discord.io/DanBot1) .
Private Messages are only allowed if the both users are member of a common server (Guild)
